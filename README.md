# INST-BRUTE
This Python script performs a brute-force attack on the Instagram login page to attempt to guess the correct password for a given username. It utilizes a combination of Selenium and requests to mimic human behavior and make the brute-force attempts less detectable

Features:

    Dynamic Headers and User Agents:
        The script rotates through a list of user agents to simulate requests from different browsers, making the attacks appear more like genuine user interactions.

    Proxy Rotation:
        To further obscure the attack and avoid IP blocking, the script rotates through a list of proxies. Each request can be sent through a different proxy, which helps in maintaining anonymity and bypassing rate limits.

    Headless Browser Simulation:
        Uses Selenium with a headless Chrome browser to interact with the Instagram login page. This approach mimics real user behavior, such as delays between actions, and captures necessary cookies for authentication.

    CSRF Token Extraction:
        Extracts the CSRF token required for form submissions from the initial login page request, ensuring that the login attempts are valid and accepted by Instagram.

    Password File Handling:
        Reads passwords from a file and tries each one in sequence. If a password is found, the script saves the response from Instagram into an HTML file for review.

    Verbose Output:
        When enabled, prints detailed information about each login attempt, including the password being tried, status codes, and response lengths. This feature aids in monitoring the progress of the brute-force attack.

    Error Handling:
        Includes error handling for request failures and exceptions to ensure the script continues running even if individual requests fail.

Important Note: Brute-forcing login credentials is against Instagramâ€™s terms of service and can be illegal. Use this script responsibly and only in authorized scenarios, such as for educational purposes or on your own accounts.
